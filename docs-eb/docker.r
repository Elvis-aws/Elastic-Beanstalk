    - Elastic Beanstalk supports the deployment of web applications from Docker containers
    - With Docker containers, you can define your own runtime environment 
    - You can also choose your own platform, programming language, and any application dependencies, such as 
      package managers or tools, which typically arent supported by other platforms
    - Docker containers are self contained and include all the configuration information and software that your 
      web application requires to run. 
    - All environment variables that are defined in the Elastic Beanstalk console are passed to the containers
    - By using Docker with Elastic Beanstalk, you have an infrastructure that handles all the details of capacity 
      provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring
